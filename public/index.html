      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          Welcome! I'm a Computer Science + Advertising major at the University
          of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating in May 2026. I’m
          passionate about combining technology and creativity to craft
          accessible designs and bring ideas to life through creative coding.
          Below are some of the projects I have worked on.

   Project 1 
    <h2>Hinge Redesign</h2>
    <p>Iterative Design | User Testing | User Research | Accessibility</p>
    <p>
      Project Summary: Improve the design and appeal of an educational card
      game, Tower of Babel, meant to familiarize college students with archival
      research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insight 1: "Conversations often stay surface-level, making it hard to form
      genuine relationships, leading to unresponsiveness or ghosting."
    </p>
    <p>My Solution:</p>
    <p>Original Design:</p>
    <p>My Design:</p>
    <p>
      Insight 2: "Users rely on photos and physical attractiveness when
      determining matches, which can overshadow a person’s character."
    </p>
    <p>My Solution:</p>
    <p>Original Design:</p>

    <p>
      Project Summary: Improve the design and appeal of an educational card
      game, Tower of Babel, meant to familiarize college students with archival
      research.
    </p>
    <p>Problem 1: "The design lacks visual appeal."</p>
    <p>My Solution:</p>
    <p>Original Design:</p>
    <p>My Design:</p>
    <p>
      Problem 2: "Information presentation feels overwhelming and difficult to
      navigate for users."
    </p>
    <p>My Solution:</p>
    <p>Problem 3: "It doesn't feel fun or like a game."</p>
    <p>My Solution:</p> -->

    <p>
      Problem 2: "Information presentation feels overwhelming and difficult to
      navigate for users."
    </p>
    <p>My Solution: I categorized the information under a visual hierarchy in order to reduce users' cognitive load. </p>

    <p>My Design:</p>
    <p>Problem 3: "It doesn't feel fun or like a game."</p>
    <p>
      My Solution: I designed personalization features to increase "game-like" feel.
      <ul>players can choose visually appealing and accessible color palettes they enjoy for their screens </ul>
      <ul>players can choose individualized frames to personalize and decorate the cards they play </ul>
