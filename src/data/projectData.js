      "This was my first deep dive into working with AI, where I took ownership of implementing our AI tool. Along the way, I developed a stronger understanding of APIs and prompt engineering through hands-on experimentation and problem-solving.",
      "By connecting our AI tool with the rest of the system, I gained meaningful exposure to how full-stack projects are designed and executed. I learned about both high-level and low-level architecture from my senior coach and worked with technologies that were new to me, including Gemini, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.",
      "Beyond coding, I improved at documenting and diagramming my work to communicate it more clearly. I created professional diagrams such as solution architecture, data flows, and system designs, while also considering SOLID principles and non-functional requirements throughout the process.",

While our initial plans were ambitious, we focused on the features that would deliver the greatest value. When the client introduced a mid-project pivot, we quickly adjusted priorities and concentrated on what mattered most, ultimately delivering a strong final product.",
      "I collaborated closely with engineering and product coaches and received frequent feedback on my work. Rather than being discouraged by critiques, I treated them as opportunities to improve and used them as motivation to grow, making significant progress in a short timeframe.",
