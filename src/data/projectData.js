      "This was my first time working heavily with AI. For this project, I was in charge of implementing our AI tool. I learned more about API usage and prompt engineering through this experience.",
      "Through connecting our AI tool to all other aspects of the project, I gained valuable insight as to how full-stack projects are structured and implemented. I learned about high-level and low-level architectures from my senior coach as well as many technologies I had never worked with or even heard of, including Gemini, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.",
      "Outside of simply coding, I learned how to document and diagram my work in a more professional manner to present to others. This included creating diagrams such as solution architecture, data diagram, and high and low-level architecture. I also had to consider SOLID principles and non-functional requirements as I worked.",
